RLFactory is an **easy** and **efficient** RL post-training framework for **Agentic Learning**. 

RL-Factory decouples the environment from RL post-training, enabling training with just a tool config and reward function while supporting async tool-calling to make RL post-training **2x faster**.

Current version natively supports one-click **DeepSearch** training and features multi-turn tool-calling, model judge reward, and training of multiple models including **Qwen3**. More easy and efficient agentic learning modules will be added in upcoming features.

<div align="center">
  <b>Now, everyone can easily and quickly train an Agent with Qwen3 (as base models) and MCP tools!</b>
</div>

## Our Framework Design
Our goal is to enable users to focus on reward logic and tool setup for fast agentic learning with minimal code, while hardcore developers could focus on improving training efficiency and model performance. 

For **easy-to-use**, we decouple the environment from RL-based post-training with several advantages. 
+ **Easy-to-design reward function**: Calculate rewards through **rules**, **model-judge**, and even **tools** to meet all your requirements for reward function.
+ **Seamless tool setup**: Simply provide the configuration file for your **MCP tools** and custom tools to integrate them into RL learning.
+ **Multi-Agent extention**: Convert your agent to the MCP format for easy Multi-Agent Interaction. LLM chat simulation will be also added in the future to improve multi-turn dialogue capabilities. 

For **efficient learning**, we develope several essential modules within the RL post-training framework, making training **2x faster**.
+ **Efficient tool-call**: Improve online RL training efficiency through batch processing and asynchronous parallel tool calls.
+ **Efficient reward calculation**: Deploy LRM (like QwQ-32B) in a distributed manner for efficient **model judging**, and use asynchronous parallelism to speed up reward calculation. 

For **future progression**, we will continue to prioritize **"easy"** and **"efficient"**.
+ **Easier**: Use WebUI to process data, define tool & environment, adjust training configuration, and manage project. (The WebUI is under rapid development.)
+ **More efficient**: Continuously iterating and improving the training framework (such as AsyncLLMEngine) and RL training algorithms.

## Demo in DeepSearch Training
+ In [`docs/rl_factory/main_tutorial.md`](docs/rl_factory/main_tutorial.md), we provide an RLFactory reproduction example of [Search-R1](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1). We use `Qwen3-4B` and `Qwen3-8B` as the base model for RL training. 
+ **Easy**: Start with Qwen3 and MCP tools to quickly train your own DeepSearch Agent.
  + Provide only one tool configuration and one reward function to start training! 
  + Qwen3 demonstrates significant advantages in Agent Learning. It can accurately call tools even without SFT, and it also supports the MCP protocol.

+ **Efficient**: Enjoy the efficient training enabled by asynchronous parallel tool-call.
  + Compared to Search-R1 based on the original verl, the required training time is reduced by **1.5 to 2 times**, and the efficiency gain is even greater if a **model judge** is involved.
  + After 100 steps of training (about 5 hours in 8*A100), `Qwen3-4B` achieves a score of 0.458 and `Qwen3-8B` achieves a score of 0.463. 
+ The table below presents our training results under identical computational resources, software, and verl versions
  + RLFactory trains in about half the time of Search-R1, demonstrating high efficiency.
  + Qwen3 as the base model outperforms Qwen2.5, enabling domain-specific tool-calling via RL post-training without SFT.
